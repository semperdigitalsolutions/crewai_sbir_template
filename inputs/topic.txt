## Description
The U.S. Space Force (USSF) faces unprecedented challenges in planning, simulating, and executing logistics missions within the space domain, where traditional terrestrial systems fall short in addressing orbital mechanics, rapid launch dynamics, intermodal cargo transfers, and the fluid nature of space mobility. These limitations constrain operational agility, elevate mission risks, and impede the evolution of responsive sustainment strategies aligned with core doctrines. The Virtual Space Cargo Deployment Function (VS-CDF) emerges as a transformative AI-enabled digital twin platform designed to facilitate real-time planning, simulation, optimization, and visualization of cargo deployments for space logistics. Spanning pre-mission preparation to live execution, VS-CDF empowers planners with intelligent tools for cargo optimization—factoring in vehicle constraints, payload dynamics, and orbital conditions—while incorporating immersive 3D modeling, augmented/virtual reality interfaces, and multi-modal human-machine interactions. It integrates supply chain risk assessments, contingency simulations, and seamless interoperability with DoD logistics networks, including the Spaceport of the Future Common Operating Picture and Joint nodes like USTRANSCOM, MAJCOM, and FLDCOM. By fostering predictive, energy-efficient sustainment practices, VS-CDF enhances mission readiness, shortens deployment timelines, and bolsters decision-making in contested space environments, ultimately bridging the divide between conceptual innovation and operational deployment in support of USSF priorities.
<argument name="citation_id">6</argument>

## Objectives
The primary goal is to create an AI-enabled digital twin platform (VS-CDF) that supports comprehensive space cargo deployment planning, simulation, and decision-making for USSF logistics operations. This includes enabling mission planners to model, visualize, and optimize cargo movements throughout the deployment lifecycle, from pre-mission scenarios to real-time contingencies, while ensuring integration with DoD systems to boost readiness and efficiency.
- **Phase I Objective**: As a Direct-to-Phase II (D2P2) topic, no Phase I awards will be made; instead, proposers must submit a feasibility study demonstrating Phase I-type efforts, including stakeholder identification, integration pathways, and applicability to other DoD or government users.
- **Phase II Objective**: Develop and demonstrate a functional prototype of the VS-CDF for end-to-end logistics planning, simulation, and optimization, validated with representative data.
- **Phase III Objective** (implied): Transition the platform to operational use in military and commercial sectors, focusing on strategic integration and broad adoption for space logistics.

## Phases
### Phase I
This topic is designated as Direct-to-Phase II (D2P2), meaning no Phase I awards will be issued. Proposers must provide a D2P2 proposal accompanied by documentation of a completed "Phase I-type" feasibility study. The study should:
1. Identify potential stakeholders for adapting the solution to USAF/USSF needs.
2. Outline pathways for integration with DAF operations, including technology development, regulatory compliance, and system interoperability.
3. Describe potential applications for other DoD or governmental customers.
Deliverables include the feasibility documentation to validate readiness for Phase II advancement.
<argument name="citation_id">6</argument>

### Phase II
Develop and demonstrate a fully functional VS-CDF digital twin prototype for comprehensive space cargo logistics support. Key tasks include:
- Building an operational prototype for simulating and optimizing cargo deployments across diverse mission scenarios.
- Integrating AI tools for cargo configuration, route optimization, timeline management, and contingency handling.
- Enabling multi-user collaboration for Joint, Coalition, and interagency teams.
- Validating the system with live or historical DoD data to evaluate accuracy, adaptability, and decision-making impact.
Deliverables: Prototype software integrated with DoD networks, AI models, visualization tools, demonstration results, final report, and commercialization roadmap.
<argument name="citation_id">6</argument>

### Phase III
Transition the VS-CDF prototype into a deployed capability for military and commercial applications. Focus on supporting SSC, USTRANSCOM, MAJCOM, FLDCOM, and Joint planners in operational planning and training. Commercial uses include optimization for aerospace firms, satellite launches, and supply chain modeling. Expected TRL at entry: 8-9, with transitions coordinated through USSF entities and industry partners.
