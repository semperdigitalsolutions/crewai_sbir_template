Program Description: Modern defense innovation often excels at the edge but stalls at the center—where promising technologies struggle to transition due to fragmented visibility, misaligned priorities, and lack of actionable evaluation tools. From concept to prototype, many initiatives fail to bridge the gap between innovation and operational impact. Project AXIS 54 addresses this challenge by delivering a practical, AI enabled framework to assess, prioritize, and align emerging technologies with mission objectives. Designed for use by capability developers, acquisition teams, and decision-makers across the space logistics and sustainment enterprise.
 
The goal of this effort is to develop a scalable, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled
decision-support framework that enables faster, more informed prioritization of emerging technologies across the space sustainment and logistics enterprise. Project AXIS 54 will equip cross-functional teams with structured tools to assess innovation alignment, technical maturity, and operational relevance— reducing transition friction and accelerating mission-impactful capabilities.
 
The Phase I Objective is to design and validate core framework components, AI integration pathways, and representative use cases to guide prototype development in Phase II.
 
Aligned with the Secretary of Defense’s 17 priority areas—including readiness, innovation speed, and ecosystem resilience—AXIS 54 enables structured yet flexible evaluation of technology portfolios. It empowers leaders to elevate the most mission-relevant innovations, reinforcing readiness and sustainment in support of high-priority U.S. Space Force (USSF) operations. Instead of delivering a rigid platform, AXIS 54 will offer a modular toolkit—scalable for enterprise planning and adaptable for agile experimentation teams. It ensures that initiatives with the greatest potential for lethality, agility, and sustainability are identified early, matured strategically, and transitioned efficiently.
