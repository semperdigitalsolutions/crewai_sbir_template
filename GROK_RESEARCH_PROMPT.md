## Description

Modern defense innovation often excels at the edge but stalls at the center—where promising technologies struggle to transition due to fragmented visibility, misaligned priorities, and lack of actionable evaluation tools. From concept to prototype, many initiatives fail to bridge the gap between innovation and operational impact. Project AXIS 54 addresses this challenge by delivering a practical, AI-enabled framework to assess, prioritize, and align emerging technologies with mission objectives. Designed for use by capability developers, acquisition teams, and decision-makers across the space logistics and sustainment enterprise, AXIS 54 will support:

- Scoring and visualization of initiatives based on operational relevance, technical maturity, transition readiness, and system feasibility.

- Warfighter-centric planning using intuitive visual models that promote alignment across stakeholders.

- Feedback loops that track early-stage innovations and guide them toward successful integration.

AI will serve as a core enabler, automating pattern recognition across portfolios, flagging integration risks, and surfacing dependencies. Machine learning models will continuously refine prioritization logic using real-world datasets, improving insight fidelity and accelerating informed decision-making. Aligned with the Secretary of Defense’s 17 priority areas—including readiness, innovation speed, and ecosystem resilience—AXIS 54 enables structured yet flexible evaluation of technology portfolios. It empowers leaders to elevate the most mission-relevant innovations, reinforcing readiness and sustainment in support of high-priority U.S. Space Force (USSF) operations. Instead of delivering a rigid platform, AXIS 54 will offer a modular toolkit—scalable for enterprise planning and adaptable for agile experimentation teams. It ensures that initiatives with the greatest potential for lethality, agility, and sustainability are identified early, matured strategically, and transitioned efficiently.

Ultimately, AXIS 54 bridges the gap between innovation and implementation—equipping both military and commercial decision-makers with a robust, AI-enabled framework to make faster, more informed decisions about which technologies to advance and how best to deploy them.

## Objectives

The goal of this effort is to develop a scalable, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled decision-support framework that enables faster, more informed prioritization of emerging technologies across the space sustainment and logistics enterprise. Project AXIS 54 will equip cross-functional teams with structured tools to assess innovation alignment, technical maturity, and operational relevance—reducing transition friction and accelerating mission-impactful capabilities.

- **Phase I Objective**: Design and validate core framework components, AI integration pathways, and representative use cases to guide prototype development in Phase II.

- **Phase II Objective**: Develop and deliver a functional, AI-enabled prototype of the AXIS 54 framework that supports enterprise-level innovation planning, technology prioritization, and transition decision-making.

- **Phase III Objective** (implied): Focus on military and commercial applications, strengthening strategic technology insertion and long-term sustainment planning, with pathways for broader DoD and commercial adoption.

## Phases

### Phase I

The Phase I objective is to establish the foundational elements of a modular decision-support toolkit that enables cross-functional teams to assess, align, and communicate the operational value of emerging technologies. Phase I focuses on validating a scalable, AI-enabled framework that helps prioritize innovation efforts in alignment with Space Systems Command (SSC), SpaceWERX, and broader USSF mission objectives.

The scope and key tasks for this Phase I effort include:
